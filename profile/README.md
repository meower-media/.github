## What is Meower?
Meower is a friendlier social media platform. Meower is completely free to use, 100% open-source, advertisement and tracker free, all
while being designed for humans. There are fluffy cats, easter eggs, (bad) jokes and more. 

## Our Project Statement
The Meower project strives to create, develop, maintain, and promote a 100% libre social media platform, encourage a healthier
and friendlier usage of social media, and uphold individual rights and privacy.
